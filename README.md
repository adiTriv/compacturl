Welcome to Compacturl


What's this app..?

You probably heard of "tinyurl" or "bitly" kind of services that lets you exchange a long url with a short one, In this app I also tried to have a similar functionality, you can enter a long url and can have a comparatively shorter one.

So, why do you need a short url..?

Suppose you find an interesting page over web and want to share it, a short url will be easy to put in social media posts and to share via chats / messages and easy to remember.
